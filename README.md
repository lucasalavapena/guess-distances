# Guess-distances

Game to guess the distances in km between cities (currently I am just using captial cities) on https://lucasalavapena.github.io/guess-distances/ or the main branch. However, on this branch has a corresponding backend, the backend can be found in https://github.com/Caramelised-Onion/cities-api (which is also used for other geography projects). This backend allows one to potentially get asked the distance between any two cities on Earth and can be furthered restricted with radius from Lat, Long and min population parameters.
